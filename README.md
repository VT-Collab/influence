# A Unified Framework for Robots that Influence Humans over Long-Term Interaction
This repository provides the implementation of our Unified formalism in four different simulated environments. The videos for our experiments can be found [here](youtube link)

## Installation and Setup

To run simulations, clone the repo using
```
git clone https://github.com/VT-Collab/influence.git
```

The required packages will install the first time that you run any of the Julia scripts.

## Implementation
The implementation details for each experiment are provided in the respective directories:
- [Highway Environment](https://github.com/VT-Collab/influence/tree/master/sim-highway)

- [Circle Environment](https://github.com/VT-Collab/influence/tree/master/sim-circle)

- [Driving Environment](https://github.com/VT-Collab/influence/tree/master/sim-driving)

- [Robot Environment](https://github.com/VT-Collab/influence/tree/master/sim-robot)
